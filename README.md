## Nonsense

*who needs a million monkeys?*

A continuation of the old Perl Nonsense CFG-parser on Humorix

Version 0.7 (September 11, 2020)

- Extended with weight factoring for section variables and and literal items.
- Removed the deprecated CGI.pm module and replaced the functionality with Perl URI and HTTP modules. This should make it possible again to run it as CGI application with a recent Perl distribution.

Version 0.6 and earlier: Author: James Baughn with CGI support contributed by Fred Hirsch and small changes contributed by Peter Suschlik
